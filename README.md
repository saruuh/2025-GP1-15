# Labbaik

## Introduction
Muslims worldwide make their way to Mecca every year to perform Hajj and Umrah, journeys that hold immense spiritual value. In 2024 alone, the Kingdom welcomed over 15 million pilgrims. This global gathering brings extraordinary diversity, yet also real challenges:
• Uncertainty when performing rituals
• Language barriers limiting access to guidance
• Difficulty finding trusted multilingual Fatwa sources
Labbaik aims to support pilgrims throughout their sacred journey by offering step-by-step guidance, language support, Tawaf and Sa’ee tracking, and authentic Fatwa sourced from reliable organizations such as Alifta. This solution aligns with Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation initiatives, reflected in the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah’s 10th place ranking among 96 government bodies in the 2024 transformation index.
Labbaik seeks to enhance the pilgrimage experience through modern innovation while preserving the essence of tradition.
